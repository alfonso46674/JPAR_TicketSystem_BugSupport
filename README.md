# JPARTicketSystem BugSupport
Cloud computing project consisting in the creation of ticket system for bug support. A client creates a ticket stating that a bug was found in their code, then a L2 dev assigns the ticket to a L3 dev, which will work to find and resolve the bug. Once fixed, the code will be uploaded for the client to see and review.
